To change the address to thebarker.net with nothing else:

In Joomla htaccess:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} home2/thebark1/
RewriteRule ^home2/thebark1/(.*) http://thebarker.net/$1 [R=301,L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !home2/thebark1/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /home2/thebark1/$1 [L]


In base htaccess:

RewriteBase /home2/thebark1/


In public_html/home2/thebark1/configuration.php:

public $live_site = 'http://thebarker.net';

- Do the same with log and temp
	- Necessary?
