For my website, I found a host with Joomla, and installed the template in the Used Template folder in Joomla.

I also installed all the modules in the Joomla Modules folder. They are general use modules not written by me.


The images are put into constructo main edit page's image slider section. Image sources included.


Follow the instructions in the Script section.
